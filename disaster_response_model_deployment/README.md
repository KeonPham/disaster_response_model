# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
Disaster events often bring chaos, but effective communication can be a lifeline. By building a machine learning pipeline, creating an API capable of categorizing these messages, ensuring they reach the appropriate relief agencies promptly.
In a world increasingly affected by natural and man-made disasters, this project isn't just valuableâ€”it's essential. By mapping data science concept with real-world impact, we are not only advancing our skills but also contributing to the greater good.

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
